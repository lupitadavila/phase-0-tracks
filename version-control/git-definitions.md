# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  
Why is it useful? Version control allows you to keep track of files and projects at different save points. It is is useful because you are able to restore older versions or track any changes that have been made by other users if your project is in the cloud on github.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a movable pointer to one of your commits made in git. It allows you to work on the files without affecting the master branch or source code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically a save point of your files/git project. Each time a change is made and you want the changes tracked, you should commit. A good commit message includes a concise description of what changes were made so that it is easily understood if read later.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when git fails to merge your branches. For the most part git does a good job of handling merges, but there are times when changing the same line on the same file by multiple user causes errors and you will need to step in and fix the issue.
