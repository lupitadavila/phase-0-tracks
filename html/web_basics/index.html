		<h2>Popular Characters</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Steven Universe</strong>: A human/Gem hybrid as a result of his parentage, Steven is an extraordinarily unique being with innate powers beyond that of both normal humans and Gems. While only a child, Steven has steadily grown from a tag-along to the Crystal Gems into an equal amongst their ranks thanks to his good-hearted nature and resourcefulness. Though he is a part of a monumental legacy, Steven is devoted to fulfilling his destiny as protector of humanity, just as his mother was before him. <a href="http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Steven_Universe_(character)" target="blank">[Source]</a></li>
			<li><strong>Garnet</strong>:the fusion of Ruby and Sapphire and the current de-facto leader of the Crystal Gems after the previous leader Rose Quartz. Garnet is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in the rebellion against the Gem Homeworld, and afterwards assisted her friends in protecting the Earth over the next millennia. After Rose Quartz gave up her physical form to give birth to her son, Steven Universe, Garnet took over as the leader of the group. <a href="http://steven-universe.wikia.com/wiki/Garnet" target="blank">[Source]</a></li>
