#jQuery Notes
My plan for learning jQuery include the following:
* Find 2-3 resources to read
* Test out in browser (console)
* Look for free online classes such as Code Academy

The reason I chose these methods are because I learn best by doing. By looking up documentation and resources, I can start testing out jQuery myself. Also, I have found online tutorials and classes to be helpful as well.

I enjoyed the try.jquery.com page because of the informative videos. I also enjoyed just going into the console and testing out jquery on an existing web page.
